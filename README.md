This is just a quick litte script you can add to your R markdown file and run at the end. 
All your working files should be saved and your git repo already set up with the files you wish to be tracked.
This code does not push it just does quick local commits. (although it's easy to add a line to the python if you want it to push as well)
Code was written by googles AI and then edited by me.
If you want to be really slick, you can automate this script with cron, windows task scheduler etc.
