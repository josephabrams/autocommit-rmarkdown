# Autogit commit script and example in R markdown

## This is just a quick little script you can add to your R markdown file and run at the end. 

### All your working files should be saved, and your git repo should already be set up with the files you wish to be tracked.

- This code does not push; it just does quick local commits. (although it's easy to add a line to the Python if you want it to push as well)
- Google's AI wrote the code, and then I edited it.

### Note: If you want to be really slick, you can automate this script with Cron, Windows task scheduler, etc.
