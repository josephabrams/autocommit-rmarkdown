Lets test some changes:

How about this?

Lets try making some more changes and see if this works?

Put this at the end of your code and run it to automatically commit, remember to still push for saving to github, this only does local saves.
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#code will show error if files are not saved!

python_script_path <- "/home/joseph/.r/git_commit_script.py" # Replace with the actual path
system(paste("python", python_script_path), intern = TRUE)

```
